<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-time-to-finish-all-jobs-ii/">2323. Find Minimum Time to Finish All Jobs II</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><div><p>You are given two <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer arrays <code>jobs</code> and <code>workers</code> of <strong>equal</strong> length, where <code>jobs[i]</code> is the amount of time needed to complete the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> job, and <code>workers[j]</code> is the amount of time the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> worker can work each day.</p>

<p>Each job should be assigned to <strong>exactly</strong> one worker, such that each worker completes <strong>exactly</strong> one job.</p>

<p>Return <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> number of days needed to complete all the jobs after assignment.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> jobs = [5,2,4], workers = [1,7,5]
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
- Assign the 2<sup>nd</sup> worker to the 0<sup>th</sup> job. It takes them 1 day to finish the job.
- Assign the 0<sup>th</sup> worker to the 1<sup>st</sup> job. It takes them 2 days to finish the job.
- Assign the 1<sup>st</sup> worker to the 2<sup>nd</sup> job. It takes them 1 day to finish the job.
It takes 2 days for all the jobs to be completed, so return 2.
It can be proven that 2 days is the minimum number of days needed.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> jobs = [3,18,15,9], workers = [6,5,1,3]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
- Assign the 2<sup>nd</sup> worker to the 0<sup>th</sup> job. It takes them 3 days to finish the job.
- Assign the 0<sup>th</sup> worker to the 1<sup>st</sup> job. It takes them 3 days to finish the job.
- Assign the 1<sup>st</sup> worker to the 2<sup>nd</sup> job. It takes them 3 days to finish the job.
- Assign the 3<sup>rd</sup> worker to the 3<sup>rd</sup> job. It takes them 3 days to finish the job.
It takes 3 days for all the jobs to be completed, so return 3.
It can be proven that 3 days is the minimum number of days needed.
